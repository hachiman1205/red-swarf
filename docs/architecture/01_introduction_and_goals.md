# Introduction and Goals
Red Swarf is a project I wanted to create to teach myself how to use embedded rust. The project itself aims to provide users a system that will monitor the dust in a wood workshop and inform users of the level. 

## Requirements Overview
The overall goal of the device is to monitor dust levels in an area and report if levels are too high.
